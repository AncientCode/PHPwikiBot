PHPwikiBot is a free and open source, object-oriented MediaWiki bot based on WikiBot, APIbot and peachy with massive modification.

Some Features are:
* Easy to read documentation generated by PHPDoc
* Pywikipedia Bot style bot with many utilities
* Single cURL Handle for the entire object instead of opening one per request
* Exception based rather than return value
* YAML-based configuration, done using spyc

Requirements: For most functions, MediaWiki 1.15+ is enough and it's used on most wikis. 1.12+ works for most functions. You really should use 1.16+ since the upload is done with API which is supported only in 1.16+.

Certain features are not implemented because this is designed mainly for bots, I mean, bot users. Watch are used mainly by normal user so it not a priority.
